# Computational Environment Paired Example 3

A branch in GitHub is a pointer to a specific snapshot of the repository, on top of which new work can be saved independently from work ongoing on the original snapshot.
There are three branches in this repository.

* `master`: https://github.com/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-3/tree/master
* `branch-a`: https://github.com/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-3/tree/branch-a
* `branch-b`: https://github.com/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-3/tree/branch-b

There is an **identical** Jupyter notebook file in all three branches.

* `branch-a` has an `environment.yml` file. You can access the binder for this branch at: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-3/branch-a?filepath=demo.ipynb
* `branch-b` has an `environment.yml` file. You can access the binder for this branch at: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgibson91/CompEnv-PairedExample-3/branch-b?filepath=demo.ipynb

## Instructions

1) Click the links for each branch above.
   (You may wish to right click and select "Open Link in a New Tab" in order to keep these instructions visible.)
   When they have finished loading, the `demo.ipynb` notebook will be visible.

2) Run the code in each notebook!

**Q's:**

* What's different between these two branches?
* What is the difference in the code?
* How do these differences arise?
